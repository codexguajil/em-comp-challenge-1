Hey ya'll,

So this is my static comp. I made it on Carine Roitfeld, the former editor of French Vogue. It's totes responsive. The boxes squish and stretch. I used flexbox and percentages to make it responsive. Also, the mobile is just a more squish boxed version of the og. I think it works! And it's not an ugly mobile site and it would be fun to click through.
